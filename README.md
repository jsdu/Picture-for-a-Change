# Picture-for-a-Change
Picture for a Change allows users to take and share pictures and add a filter or sticker for a cause that they support. 

## Inspiration
Nspire's theme of **sharing** is extremely important to me and I was inspired by one of the biggest Apps, Snapchat which allows users to add "stickers". I was also inspired by Facebook and their filters during Gay Pride and Paris Attacks. Unfortunately, there was no good way to pick and choose which filters you wanted to share, which is why I developed Picture for a Change.

## What it does
Picture for a Change allows users to take and share pictures and add a filter or sticker for a cause that they support. 
I have a wide selection of stickers for the user to choose from including charities, politics, and world wide events. Users must be logged in to their Facebook or their Twitter in order to share their image.

## How I built it
I built the App from the ground up in Swift. I used Clarifai's API to scan the picture and give relevant tags which I then process to give relevant stickers for the users. 

## Challenges I ran into
I had a tough time image processing the sticker to be attached to the user's picture. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I created a fully functional and extremely polished App. I designed the UI/UX to be very clean and intuitive for the user to use.

## What I learned
I learned how to merge two images together. 

## What's next for Picture for a Change
I hope to work with sponsors to get their pictures up and running and hopefully scale this idea into an actual project.
I hope to add more stickers as well.
